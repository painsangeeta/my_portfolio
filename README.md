# [Project 1: Covid Data Exploration: Project Overview](https://github.com/painsangeeta/DataAnalysisPortfolioProjects)
* Selecting the required data from ’Covid Deaths’ and ’Covid Vaccinations’ dataset. I have explored both the
datasets to analyze different relations between the features of them.
* I have found the countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to the total Population and also found the
countries with highest death count per population.
* Analyzed Total Population vs Vaccinations by joining two datasets. Vaccinations will ensure the safety of the
countries with highest infection rate.


# [Project 2: Analysis Of My Spotify Data](https://github.com/painsangeeta/My_Spotify_Data_Analysis)
* The idea behind this project is to analyze my own song-listening data from spotify and explore my music taste from
an Analysts point of view.
* I’ve analyzed different metrics like, top 10 songs, top 10 artists etc; and found some interesting results. For
instance, the day on which I listened to maximum number of songs and the day on which I listened songs for
maximum duration, are different.
* I got the overall view of my music listening data and presented it with various charts to visualize it.
* Python library used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
