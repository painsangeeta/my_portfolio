# [Project 1: Covid Data Exploration: Project Overview](github.com/painsangeeta/DataAnalysisPortfolioProjects)
* Selecting the required data from ’Covid Deaths’ and ’Covid Vaccinations’ dataset. I have explored both the
datasets to analyze different relations between the features of them.
* I have found the countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to the total Population and also found the
countries with highest death count per population.
* Analyzed Total Population vs Vaccinations by joining two datasets. Vaccinations will ensure the safety of the
countries with highest infection rate.
